# RanBALL: An Ensemble <ins>Ran</ins>dom Projection Model for Identifying Subtypes of <ins>B</ins>-cell <ins>A</ins>cute <ins>L</ins>ymphoblastic <ins>L</ins>eukemia

**RanBALL** (an Ensemble **Ran**dom Projection-Based Model for Identifying **B**-Cell **A**cute **L**ymphoblastic **L**eukemia Subtypes), an accurate and cost-effective model for B-ALL subtype identification based on transcriptomic profiling only. Leveraging the random projection and SVM techniques, our **RanBALL** enables to identify accurately and efficiently 20 distinct B-ALL subtypes, which could provide reliable diagnostic insights that can significantly aid clinical decision-making processes.

## Installation
1. Clone the RanBALL git repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wan-mlab/RanBALL.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory of RanBALL package
```bash
cd /your path/RanBALL
pip install .
```
## Tutorials
### Jupyter notebook
1. Modify the System Path and import module
```bash
import sys; sys.path.append('RanBALL')
from RanBALL import RanBALL
```
2. unzip and read the test file
```bash
test = pd.read_csv('filter_TPM_test.csv', index_col=0)
```
3. B-ALL subtype prediction
```bash
RanBALL.Predict(Exp = test, exp_type = 'TPM')
```
   exp_type also could be 'Raw_count' and 'FPKM', which would be transformed to TPM for model training.

4. Example Outputs

![Example Outputs](output1.png)

The prediction results will be stored and exported to the Prediction_results.csv

### Prediction for a New Patient Sample
1. Prepare the input file
   Format: Gene expression matrix with **ENSEMBL ID** as columns and **patient/sample names** as rows.<br>
   **Importan**t: The order of ENSEMBL ID must be the same as in the example file (filter_TPM_test.csv) to ensure consistency with the trained model.<br>
   Save your file as new_patient_TPM.csv.
2. Load your new patient data
```bash
import pandas as pd
new_patient = pd.read_csv('new_patient_TPM.csv', index_col=0)
```
3. Run prediction using the trained RanBALL model
```bash
from RanBALL import RanBALL
RanBALL.Predict(Exp=new_patient, exp_type='TPM')
```
4. Check output results
   After running the command, the prediction results will appear in Prediction_results.csv
